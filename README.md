# Projet-MRNF-Occupation-des-Sols
The project aims to produce an 10 m accurate land cover for the Quebec Province, Canada. We use Deep Learning and Sentinel-2 imagery.
The provided functions are designed to create complex, layered images that simulate real-world observations, particularly useful for training machine learning models on synthetic data. The emphasis on randomness and variability (e.g., random shapes, distortions, and placements) helps ensure a diverse set of images, enhancing the robustness of models trained on such data.
